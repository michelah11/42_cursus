File: colors.h
This header file defines several color constants used throughout the fdf program.

The color definitions in the colors.h file use hexadecimal notation to represent RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values.
This format is widely used in many programming environments, including web development (e.g., HTML/CSS), graphics programming, and GUI design.

Where Did This Representation Come From?
The RGB color model is a standard way to represent colors in digital systems. It is based on the principle that any color can be created
by combining three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue. Each of these primary colors is represented by an 8-bit value, allowing for
256 different intensities (0-255) per color channel.

Hexadecimal Notation: In programming, colors are often represented in hexadecimal (base 16) notation. A color in RGB is typically represented
as a 6-digit hexadecimal number, where:
The first two digits represent the intensity of Red (RR).
The next two digits represent the intensity of Green (GG).
The last two digits represent the intensity of Blue (BB).
	For example:
	0xffffff represents white (FF red, FF green, FF blue).
	0x000000 represents black (00 red, 00 green, 00 blue).

How It Is Used in the fdf Program
In the fdf program, these color constants are used to set the color of points, lines, and other graphical elements.
The colors are typically passed as arguments to drawing functions or are used to initialize color structures that handle gradients and transitions.


Setting a Pixel Color: When drawing a pixel or a line, the program will use one of these color constants to specify the color.

	pixel_to_image(image, x, y, C_RED);  // Draws a red pixel at coordinates (x, y)

Gradients: When creating color gradients, the program might interpolate between two colors, such as C_WHITE and C_BLUEY,
to create a smooth transition between them.

Color Definitions:

- Basic Colors:
# define C_WHITE 0xffffff	// White color
# define C_GREY 0x303030	// Grey color
# define C_RED 0xff0000		// Red color
# define C_GREEN 0x00ff00	// Green color
# define C_BLUE 0x0000ff	// Blue color
# define C_YELLOW 0xffff00	// Yellow color
# define C_CYAN 0x00ffff	// Cyan color
# define C_PINK 0xff00ff	// Pink color

- Custom Colors:
# define C_ORANGY 0xffa500	// Orangy color (used for color gradients)
# define C_BLUEY 0x0492c2	// Bluey color (used for color gradients)
