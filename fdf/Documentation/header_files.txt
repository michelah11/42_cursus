    - Structures:

        - t_point: Represents a 3D point with x, y, z coordinates and a color.
        - t_map: Holds the 2D array of points that make up the map, along with the mapâ€™s boundaries (max_x, max_y, max_z, min_z).
        - t_line: Represents a line between two points.
        - t_color: Holds color information for color gradients.
        - t_image: Represents an image buffer, including its pixel data and format information.
        - t_cam: Represents the camera, which controls how the map is viewed (projection, scaling, movement, rotation).
        - t_fdf: The main structure that holds everything together, including the map, camera, and image.

- colors.h: This file defines color constants (in hexadecimal) for use throughout the program.
    - Example:
        - C_WHITE: Represents the color white (0xffffff).

- keys.h: This file defines constants for keyboard keys used in the program.
    - Example:
